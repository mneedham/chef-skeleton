To get chef setup on a Fedora box you can run the following command:

sudo bash < <(curl -s -L https://raw.github.com/mneedham/chef-skeleton/master/setup.sh)

Then need to copy the files in etc_chef into /etc/chef 
And then run sudo chef-solo from a directory which has the cookbooks/roles in

Need to authomate this last bit
